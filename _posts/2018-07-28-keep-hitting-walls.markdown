<h1>Can't Get Over the Wall</h1>
<p>It's been a while since I have entered something here. I don't really know what I am doing when I journal. This journey to become a programmer is tougher than I thought. I admit I have learned more than when I tried taking CS151 back in freshman year, but I feel so confused. I feel like my mind can't remember more than a couple things before the logic gets all jumbled up. Damn, I feel dumb. I guess this is what is feels like to be humbled. However, I am too scared to reach out for help. I am paranoid and don't know what to do. I still get so upset by my parents. The leadership an morale in this family is constantly low. I resent my parents for putting my brother and I through a permanent "Cold War". It's mainly my mom being negative all the time, but I can see why because my father is oblivious to the things he says or does. I don't know if it's his fading eyesight or if he can't sense emotions or read facial cues. I feel hopeless. When can this life end?
